      <h2>Starting point</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2">
          I had close to zero experience with Angular before the project, making
          start more troublesome, but after a while started to get hang of it.
          <br />
          Scrum master role was also a first time for me, but had some idea from
          previous course how scrum works and what is the main point of using
          scrum in software development environment. Scrum master role brought
          more things to take into consideration, with new problems needed to
          get solved.<br />
          For testing I had the best starting point, as I like to "break things"
          and then find out how to fix them. At the start I had high
          expectations that testing would not be a problem at all during the
          project.

      <h2>Planned and outcome</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2">
          From the start, the design for the website application was already
          done with little to none changes requires. The only thing that needed
          real planning was how all the features should be build and what kind
          of functions and frontend and backend solutions they require to work
          completely. We planned everything as a group such as; what is the goal
          of this project, what are appropriate amount of features to call
          project successful, how project is to be expected to be done, how the
          product is to be tested during and after developing features, and much
          more. We had also made many plans on how we hold the meetings, what
          tools we are expected to use and risk management on what might happen
          and how to prevent them.<br />
          <br />
          Sadly, these plans did not come to any fruition, and in middle of
          TiCorporate I left the group, but I did manage to accomplish
          somethings I had in mind during my short time in the group.
