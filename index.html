      <h2>Starting point</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2">
          I had close to zero experience with Angular before the project, making
          start more troublesome, but after a while started to get hang of it.
          <br />
          Scrum master role was also a first time for me, but had some idea from
          previous course how scrum works and what is the main point of using
          scrum in software development environment. Scrum master role brought
          more things to take into consideration, with new problems needed to
          get solved.<br />
          For testing I had the best starting point, as I like to "break things"
          and then find out how to fix them. At the start I had high
          expectations that testing would not be a problem at all during the
          project.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Plans</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2">
          From the start, the design for the website application was already
          done with little to none changes requires. The only thing that needed
          real planning was how all the features should be build and what kind
          of functions and frontend and backend solutions they require to work
          completely. We planned everything else as a group such as; what is the
          goal of this project, what are appropriate amount of features to call
          project successful, how project is to be expected to be done, how the
          product is to be tested during and after developing features, and much
          more. We had also made many plans on how we hold the meetings, what
          tools we are expected to use and risk management on what might happen
          and how to prevent them.<br />
          <br />
          Sadly, these plans did not come to fruition, and in middle of
          TiCorporate I left the group, but I did manage to accomplish
          somethings I had in mind during my short time in the group.

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <div class="container">
        There is not a lot of things to showcase, as most of the start was
        planning and learning Angular while trying to keep scrum process
        going.<br />
        As a scrum master, the whole scrum process failed as a whole. Weekly
        reports were made on time, but not every group members hours and
        activity were written down. Sprints and the plans done by the whole
        group for the sprint, were completely neglected and my role as scrum
        master was reduced to weekly reporter.<br />
        I can see the value of using scrum in software development point of
        view, but on this project it was a disaster and completely made null. I
        wish I get to work in a project with proper scrum process in the
        future.<br />
        <br />
        As for frontend development, I was leaning Angular as we were going
        forward with the project, and mainly was bug fixing and finding out how
        we could do things, instead of developing myself.
