      <h2>Starting point</h2>
      <div class="container">
        I had close to zero experience with Angular before the project, making
        start more troublesome, but after a while started to get hang of it.
        <br />
        Scrum master role was also a first time for me, but had some idea from
        previous course how scrum works and what is the main point of using
        scrum in software development environment. Scrum master role brought
        more things to take into consideration, with new problems needed to get
        solved.<br />
        For testing I had the best starting point, as I like to "break things"
        and then find out how to fix them. At the start I had high expectations
        that testing would not be a problem at all during the project.
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Planned and outcome</h2>
      <div class="container">
        From the start, the design for the website application was already done
        with little to none changes requires. The only thing that needed real
        planning was how all the features should be build and what kind of
        functions and frontend and backend solutions they require to work
        completely. At the same time I planned how the testing and scrum should
        be put into practice, which were sadly never implemented.
