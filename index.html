      <h2>Starting point</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2">
          I had close to zero experience with Angular before the project, making
          start more troublesome, but after a while started to get hang of it.
          <br />
          Scrum master role was also a first time for me, but had some idea from
          previous course how scrum works and what is the main point of using
          scrum in software development environment. Scrum master role brought
          more things to take into consideration, with new problems needed to
          get solved.<br />
          For testing I had the best starting point, as I like to "break things"
          and then find out how to fix them. At the start I had high
          expectations that testing would not be a problem at all during the
          project.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Project planning</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2">
          From the start, the design for the website application was already
          done with little to none changes requires. The only thing that needed
          real planning was how all the features should be build and what kind
          of functions and frontend and backend solutions they require to work
          completely. We planned everything else as a group such as; what is the
          goal of this project, what are appropriate amount of features to call
          project successful, how project is to be expected to be done, how the
          product is to be tested during and after developing features, and much
          more. We had also made many plans on how we hold the meetings, what
          tools we are expected to use and risk management on what might happen
          and how to prevent them.<br />
          <br />
          Sadly, these plans did not come to fruition, and in middle of
          TiCorporate I left the group, but I did manage to accomplish
          somethings I had in mind during my short time in the group.

    <section id="outcomes">
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <div class="container">
        There is not a lot of things to showcase, as most of the start was
        planning and learning Angular while trying to keep scrum process
        going.<br />
        As a scrum master, the whole scrum process failed as a whole. Weekly
        reports were made on time, but not every group members hours and
        activity were written down. Sprints and the plans done by the whole
        group for the sprint, were completely neglected and my role as scrum
        master was reduced to weekly reporter.<br />
        I can see the value of using scrum in software development point of
        view, but on this project it was a disaster and completely made null. I
        wish I get to work in a project with proper scrum process in the
        future.<br />
        <br />
        As for frontend development, I was leaning Angular as we were going
        forward with the project, and mainly was bug fixing and finding out how
        we could do things, instead of developing myself.<br />
        The following rolltable feature was designed and the functions of it
        were made me.
        <div class="card3">
          <img
            src="/SS1.png"
            alt="Rolltable image 1."
            width="400px"
            height="500px
          "
          />
        </div>
        <div class="card3">
          The rolltable, was basicly a list where the "Encounter" feature pulled
          it's encounters from. It's idea was to be able to create fully
          customizeable lists with different events in a tabletop roleplaying
          game. And in such "encounters", some encounters are always more common
          than others, so I saw a need for a "encounter weight" type of value to
          make it more likely to get more common encounter, and make some other
          encounters rarer. In the picture on the right, the weight value is in
          basic whole numbers, which affect the chances shown in "%", which
          makes it more clearer what are the actual chances to get that specific
          encounter in this list.<br /><br />
          It was also by design to have function to create new encounters and to
          delete encounters. There were couple of things missing from the last
          build I did in the project group, image upload and selection, and live
          updating the % chance of encounters.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="card3">
          <img
            src="/SS3.png"
            alt="Rolltable image 2."
            width="400px"
            height="500px"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="card3">
          Feature worked pretty well and correctly rolled from the encounters
          taking account the weight for each encounter.<br />
          The editing page was not pretty and was little bit rushed for a
          presentation, but everything worked well enough to groups
          expectations.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="card3">
          <img
            src="/SS5.png"
            alt="Code snippet."
            width="400px"
            height="500px"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="card3">
          Most of the frontend was done by product owner, but I did the bug
          fixing and testing and while I did only a single feature to this
          project, I learned a lot of how the Angular works.<br />

          <h3>Frontend</h3>
          <p>
            I did not have much experience with Angular and had to read a lot of
            documentation to understand how the components work with each other,
            and on top of that, when went into fixing others code without proper
            comments, made it especially hard.<br />
            As seen in this portfolio site, I have no good design eye to create
            anything specially unique or special, but I manage to create
            functionality to a site and fix problems that arise in development.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p>
            I did not have the chance to do proper testing on this project, but
            I was able to talk with other projects testers and see how they have
            done their testing and also get better insight how their testing
            went.<br />
            I am still quite certain my strongest point is testing in this
            field.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Scrum master</h3>
          <p>
            I feel like I am not cut out to be Scrum master, because I lack to
            needed social skills to be in the group handling these meetings and
            talk with people daily basis to keep up with progress and needs of
            the group.<br />
            Scrum is really useful and flexible tool in development, but it does
            not matter if you are using it alone in a group.
          </p>

    <section id="future">
      <h2>Future goals</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2">
          As I mentioned before, I still think testing is my strongest skill in
          this field. For me personally it is great to get crackdown websites
          and try to break them on purpose to improve them. That said, frontend
          development and coding is needed to get better at it. Coding is great
          too, but it is not as fulfilling as testing in whole. <br />
          <br />To improve my skills, I need to get to know more coding
          languages and as a extra, try to get better at making websites look
          better. I know I don't have "eye" for asthetic things, but it is
          always great to learn how to make cleaner and visually more appealing
          products.
